## Synopsis

Simply run it from the command line. IE ./btree

**This script requires the following:

Ruby ~> 2.0.0**

## Motivation

This script is my first attempt at writing a btree class driven by a controller that manages the binary tree nodes. The following were the guidelines I was required to follow:

Rules and Properties of Nodes include:  

- Binary search tree has comparisons done on weight such that:

  left.weight < weight < right.weight.

- Nodes have names, a string value. No two nodes can have the same name.
- Nodes have a weight, an integer value. No two nodes can have the same Weight.

Note that the script currently only satisfies the assignment as it is stated, no more as yet.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
